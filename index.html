        <p>book.css is pretty neat. I should write more about it, but that's hard.</p>
        <p>You can use it by adding the following to the &lt;head&gt; of your page. <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://galenguyer.github.io/book.css/book.css" media="screen" /&gt;</pre></p>
        <p>There's no minified version for two reasons: first, I can't be bothered to make one, and b, it's 1.3kb raw, 0.5kb gzipped. It's not worth the effort, but feel free to make a minified version yourself</p>
